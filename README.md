## 🛠️ Technologies Used

For the YouTube part, the project is built on OpenAI's Whisper API, which is a Speech to Text language model used to transcribe audio files, and Langchain a framework for developing applications powered by language models. For the Podcast and Meeting part, it's mainly built using AssemblyAI API. The front-end of the application is built with Streamlit.
